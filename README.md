# Plant-identification-using-leaf-image--
an image processing / machine learning project using matlab to identify plants using their leaves images

the dataset used is called the flavia dataset which contains leaf images of about 60 different classes of plants and can be 
downloaded for free from the internet.

i downloaded 3 external libraries namely:
1. machinelearning - which contained various ml algorithms.
2.libsvm- specifically for using support vector machine.
3. utility- for mathematical, analysis and visualization operations .
